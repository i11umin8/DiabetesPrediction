# Exploratory Data Science through Diabetes Prediction

Machine learning is a cutting edge domain of computer science, which has algorithms that can learn patterns from training data and use them to produce predictions. However, depending on the algoritm and model used, we can get wildly different results. 

In order to account for this variance, I will run three different algorithms multiple times to compare the runtime and the accuracy of each algorithm. These algorithms are a Decision Tree Classifier, Regularized Linear Regression, and a Support Vector machine with a Linear Kernel. I will be exploring a dataset of medical information from Pima Indians in order to classify whether or not they have diabetes or not.
